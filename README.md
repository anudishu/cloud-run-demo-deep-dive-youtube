# cloud-run-demo-deep-dive-youtube
This repo contains all the codes that will be used to perform the demo of cloud run different use cases like :


We start with deploying a simple Cloud Run service and learn how to build it using Cloud Build and deploy the  docker image to Artifact Registry and setup continuous deployment. We will then integrate our Cloud Run service with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) to upload and download files. We will integrate with Secrets Manager to read secrets from Secret Manager. We will integrate with Cloud Pub/Sub to invoke Cloud Run service in response to an event (Event-Driven architecture). Finally We will integrate our service with Cloud SQL and connect to Cloud SQL instance using Public IP and Private IP.
